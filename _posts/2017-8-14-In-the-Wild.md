title: In the Wild
---

I'm 60 days into my first gig as a developer (2/3 through a 90-day professional apprenticeship). Now that I'm "in the wild" it seems like the perfect time to:

a.) Share what I'm learning to solidify my own knowledge
b.) Host my own blog as a fun, light side project

So here goes.

14 months ago I didn't know what a for loop was. Now I'm starting my career as a professional. That's an amazing and scary juxtaposition. There's a TON I don't know. In the past week, I've had to recommit to the fundamentals that got me here, which have nothing to do with code, or for that matter, anything technical. What has sustained me in this 14 month journey so far has been practicing the following 3 things, all of which build on one another:
<ul>
  <li>Kindness to myself and others</li>
  <li>Celebrating my inherent value</li>
  <li>Humility</li>
</ul>

Its simple to understand, and very difficult to do. In fact, I would say no one can do it on their own, and it takes a lifetime to learn. In practicing the above 3 things, I have had to actively move away from the following:

<ul>
  <li>Negative self-talk/thinking</li>
  <li>Comparison to others</li>
  <li>Worry</li>
  <li>Finding my value in my work</li>
</ul>

Briefly, here's how the 3 build on one another. If I am practicing Kindness to myself and others, I will build myself up and those around me. If I celebrate my inherent value outside of my work, I am free to practice humility, its no longer about me, its about the work. This frees me to truly enjoy it, and receive whatever critiques I need to in order to get better at it. Of course its much messier in real life. Nevertheless, the impact of this cycle has been very real for myself and those around me.

So that's where I start, however poorly. From kindness, significance, and seeking to practice humility.
